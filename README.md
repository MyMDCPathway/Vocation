## 🛠️ How We Built It

We designed and built **Vocation** using:

- 🖥️ **Next.js (Node.js, React, Tailwind)** – for the web application  
- 🤖 **Google Gemini API & Canvas** – for AI-driven pathway generation and visualization  
- 🧑‍💻 **Cursor** – for development and pair programming  
- 🗂️ **GitHub** – for version control  
- 💬 **Discord / WhatsApp** – for team communication  

---

## ⚙️ Challenges We Ran Into

- ⚡ **Understanding and implementing the Gemini API** – Required deep research, testing, and debugging to ensure proper integration.  
- 🔗 **Ensuring correct educational pathway links** – We validated every link for accuracy and reliability.  
- 🎓 **Differentiating similar majors** – Handling programs with multiple variations was a challenge for categorization and display accuracy.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments We’re Proud Of

- ✅ **Improved accuracy of pathway links** – All degree and program links are now reliable and functional.  
- ✅ **Enhanced flowchart precision** – Pathway structures now accurately reflect academic progression.  
- ✅ **Delivered under time constraints** – Built and deployed a working prototype within the hackathon timeframe.

---

## 📚 What We Learned

- 🕒 **Be more linear with time** – Sequential tasking proved far more effective than multitasking under time pressure.  
- 🤝 **Stronger team collaboration** – Clear communication, shared responsibilities, and version control streamlined our workflow.  
- 🎯 **Prioritize a single user flow first** – Focusing on one solid flow prevented unnecessary complexity and made iteration smoother.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

- 📊 Add **new visualization options** for pathway structures (graphs, charts, timelines).  
- 🔁 Implement **pathway comparison** so students can evaluate multiple routes side by side.  
- ⚡ Continue **iterating and optimizing** the prototype for full deployment.
